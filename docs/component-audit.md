# React Server Components Audit

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all components in the Cyber Hand website, identifying which should be Server Components vs. Client Components based on their functionality and requirements.

## Classification Criteria

**Server Component Candidates:**
- Static rendering without interactivity
- Data fetching components
- Components without state or effects
- SEO-critical content
- Components without browser APIs

**Client Component Candidates:**
- Interactive UI elements (buttons, forms, etc.)
- Components using React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Components using browser-only APIs
- Animation-dependent components
- Components requiring event handlers

## Component Analysis

### UI Components

| Component | Classification | Reasoning | Migration Priority |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `ui/button.tsx` | Client | Interactive element with event handlers | Medium |
| `ui/form-elements.tsx` | Client | Form inputs require client interactivity | Medium |
| `ui/icons.tsx` | Server | Static rendering with no interactivity | High |

### Custom Components

| Component | Classification | Reasoning | Migration Priority |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `custom/case-study-card.tsx` | Split | UI is static, but has hover effects | High |
| `custom/circuit-effects.tsx` | Client | Animation-dependent | Low |
| `custom/cyber-logo.tsx` | Server | Static rendering with no interactivity | High |
| `custom/navbar.tsx` | Client | Interactive navigation with state | Medium |
| `custom/page-layout.tsx` | Server | Static layout without interactivity | High |
| `custom/service-card.tsx` | Split | UI is static, but has hover effects | High |
| `custom/service-carousel.tsx` | Client | Interactive carousel with state | Low |

### Case Studies Components

| Component | Classification | Reasoning | Migration Priority |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `case-studies/case-study-card-client.tsx` | Client | Already converted to client component | Completed |
| `case-studies/case-study-card-server.tsx` | Server | Already converted to server component | Completed |
| `case-studies/case-study-client-wrapper.tsx` | Client | Interactive wrapper with filtering | Completed |
| `case-studies/case-study-content.tsx` | Server | Static content display | High |
| `case-studies/case-study-header.tsx` | Server | Static header content | High |
| `case-studies/common-elements.tsx` | Server | Reusable static elements | High |

## Implementation Plan

Based on the audit, we'll take the following approach:

1. **High Priority Migrations (Now):**
   - Convert static UI components to Server Components
   - Implement proper data fetching in Server Components
   - Create Server/Client boundaries for components requiring both

2. **Medium Priority Migrations (Next):**
   - Refine interactive components as Client Components
   - Optimize component tree structure
   - Ensure proper data flow between Server and Client Components

3. **Low Priority Migrations (Later):**
   - Address complex interactive components
   - Optimize animation performance
   - Fine-tune Server/Client boundaries

## Next Steps

1. Start with high-priority migrations:
   - Convert `ui/icons.tsx` to Server Component
   - Convert `custom/cyber-logo.tsx` to Server Component
   - Convert `custom/page-layout.tsx` to Server Component
   - Split `custom/service-card.tsx` into Server/Client parts

2. For components marked as "Split", create paired components:
   - Implement a Server Component for the core content
   - Implement a Client Component for interactive features
   - Create a clear boundary between the two
