## Architectural Alignment

The frontend implementation will maintain consistency with the existing architectural principles:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: 
   - Continue abstracting components, styles, and logic into reusable modules
   - Leverage existing utilities in the `lib` directory

2. **Modular Component Design**: 
   - Extend the component hierarchy with new UI elements placed in appropriate directories
   - Follow the established component breakdown pattern

3. **Centralized Styling**: 
   - Build upon the existing theme-based styling approach
   - Utilize the `getThemeStyle()` function for theme-aware styling

4. **Responsive First**: 
   - Maintain mobile-first approach with distinct layouts for larger screens
   - Use responsive design techniques consistent with existing patterns

5. **Type Safety**: 
   - Ensure all new components have appropriate TypeScript interfaces
   - Extend existing interfaces when necessary
   - Use specific types instead of 'any' across the codebase
   - Implement consistent naming conventions (underscore prefix for unused variables)
   - Follow strict ESLint rules for TypeScript usage

## Code Quality Standards

To maintain high code quality and developer experience, the following standards are enforced:

1. **ESLint Configuration**:
   - Follow Next.js recommended ESLint rules
   - Enforce naming conventions for variables and functions
   - Ensure proper typing with TypeScript-specific ESLint rules
   - Address all warnings and errors before deployment

2. **TypeScript Usage**:
   - Avoid 'any' types in favor of specific interfaces and types
   - Export shared types for reuse across components
   - Use type guards for runtime type checking
   - Document complex types with JSDoc comments

3. **Suspense Boundaries**:
   - Strategic placement of Suspense boundaries around async components
   - Skeleton placeholders for content during streaming
   - Optimized waterfall prevention through parallel data fetching
   - Component-level suspense with granular fallbacks for improved UX

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error boundaries in client components
   - Add structured error handling in server actions and components
   - Use consistent error messaging patterns
   - Log errors appropriately based on environment

## React Server Components Implementation

Next.js 15 provides enhanced support for React Server Components (RSC), offering significant advantages for our application:

1. **Server-Side Rendering Strategy**:

   - Use the `'use client'` directive only in components that actually need client-side functionality

2. **Performance Benefits**:
   - Reduced JavaScript payload sent to the client
   - Eliminated client-side API request waterfalls
   - Decreased Time-to-Interactive through reduced client-side JavaScript

3. **Security Advantages**:
   - Keep sensitive operations server-side (API calls, data processing)
   - Prevent exposure of API keys and secrets
   - Reduce attack surface on the client

4. **Data Fetching Patterns**:
   - Implement parallel data fetching in Server Components
   - Use React's cache() for efficient data request deduplication
   - Structure components to fetch only their required data
   - Leverage Next.js fetch API with automatic request deduplication
   - Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations
   - Use { next: { revalidate: timeInSeconds } } for time-based revalidation

5. **Streaming Implementation (Next.js 15)**:
   - Leverage App Router's native streaming capabilities for progressive UI rendering
   - Implementation of loading.js files for route-level loading indicators
   - Server data fetching without client-side JavaScript hydration cost
   - Client interactivity delivered through isolated Client Component islands
   - Clear separation between data fetching (Server Components) and interactivity (Client Components)
   - Established standardized skeleton components for consistent loading states
   - Created centralized error boundary system for graceful error handling
   - Optimized page performance with proper Server/Client Component separation
   - Ensured layout stability during progressive rendering to minimize CLS
