# MCP Orchestration Flow Improvements

This commit includes several enhancements to the MCP orchestration flow:

1. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to the test component
   - Documentation now complies with Cyber Hand's principles

2. **Orchestrator Improvements**
   - Added detailed logging for better debugging
   - Enhanced Docker configuration for validator discovery
   - Improved error handling in the orchestration process

3. **Test Scripts**
   - Created test scripts to validate the orchestration flow
   - Added PowerShell-compatible testing tools

This commit should trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to validate our MCP orchestrator and ensure it properly integrates with all validators.
