> **IMPORTANT: Documentation Migration Notice**

> The project documentation has been migrated from legacy files (PLANNING.md, TASK.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) to a comprehensive documentation structure in the `/docs` directory. Please refer to the new documentation for the most up-to-date information.

## Core Documentation

The following 5 core documentation files provide everything needed to understand and build the Cyber Hand website:

1. [**Development Guide**](/docs/getting-started/development-guide.md) - Comprehensive onboarding guide for developers
2. [**System Reference**](/docs/architecture/system-reference.md) - Complete system architecture reference
3. [**Feature Registry**](/docs/features/feature-registry.md) - Feature catalog and implementation status
4. [**Component Audit**](/docs/components/audit.md) - Component inventory and classification
5. [**Supabase Integration**](/docs/integrations/supabase-integration.md) - Database integration patterns

## Documentation Hub

For all documentation, start with the [Documentation Hub](/docs/README.md), which provides links to all available documentation resources.

## Legacy Documentation

The following legacy documentation files are being maintained temporarily for reference, but will be removed in a future update:

- `PLANNING.md` - Project planning document (migrated to `/docs/getting-started/`)
- `TASK.md` - Implementation tasks (migrated to `/docs/features/`)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture overview (migrated to `/docs/architecture/`)

Please update any references to these files to point to the new documentation structure.
